<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>PHP was my first web programming language. I already knew TCL and script languages when i started developing back ends with PHP. Unfortunately i had bad habbits and i used to thought that writting everything from the root was going to turn me in to a greate developer.</p>
<p>I've only worked with Laravel and Slim Framework on real word projects and i'm sorry for that, i should used them all from the beginning.</p>
<h4>HHVM</h4>
<p>The hacklang by Facebook was a shock for me: an attempt to bring the true async implementation for PHP and a compiler so much faster than the Zend PHP. That's amazing!</p>
