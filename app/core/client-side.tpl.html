<h3>Client Side</h3>
<p>When i started writting my first real world web applications i've decided to never go with client side!<br>
It's been a few years and now i do love client side, thanks to frameworks like AngularJS and CSS extensions as SASS and LESS.</p>
<p>I've read a few books about UI/UX, i was challenged to design web applications and do the implementations. Now, at 24 i can say that client side is my confort area the same way programming languages are.</p>
<h4>AngularJS</h4>
<p>My first app with AngularJS was with 0.X versions when AngularJS was yet seen as an evil framework. Now, others solutions like <b>IONIC Framework</b> take AngularJS and mobile applications to a next level and i'm on that game as well.</p>
<h4>SASS and LESS</h4>
<p>The first time i discovered that CSS could be extended i was like WOW! I could reduce 80 lines of CSS to 8 of SASS using @each directives, variables, mixins. This make me love CSS in fact! Now i'm able to easily generate themes based colors, do a good Mobile First implementation, etc.</p>
<h3>SEO/Marketing</h3>
<p>As a programmer i never dedicated much time to SEO until i started writting <a href="https://github.com/guilhermegeek/pi-framework/tree/dev">Pi Framework</a>. I started to understand how important SEO is, and as a programmer how i am responsible for that.</p>
<p>While developing web services, i started implementing guidelines from major companies as well take a deeper attention to response from the webservices.</p>
<p>After i found AngularJS, working with technologies like <b>Prerender</b> became a need. I eventually learned how social networks handle SEO and how Google has changed his reputation algorithm over the years.</p>
