<h3>C#</h3>
<p>C# was the first language with i worked on programming consulting. I've developed a big project for "Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia" with Agap2 company 4 years ago. Back then i was introduced to the real concepts of C# in IT consulting.</p>
<p>After working with Agap2 i've found something lovely for C#: <b>Mono</b>.</p>
<p>For me, <b>Mono</b> started to be the reason why i still love C#: been able to run it with Unix and keep a decent license. Later Xamarin came and everything turned corporative. I no longer believed in Mono the same way i did, because i knew it was a matter of time until i would have to pay in order to take the real advantages of Mono developed by Xamarin.</p>
<p>I've only developed 3 real world websites supported with Mono but i was very surprised with the after all results. I've learned that as long as you stick with the core C# and try to forget .NET API everything run smoth as fast, more than it was announced! Later i've found <b>ServiceStack</b></p>
