<h3>SysAdmin</h3>
<p>I've always been afraid of consider my self an system administrator. Since i remember i'm familiar with the Unix shell, i know how major distributions works and differ from each other as well i invested a lot of time in security.</p>
<p>Even so i didn't consider my self as a sysadmin. On the last 2 years i've deal with small projects where customers can't affoard to hire this type of services. So i started been responsible for maintaining servers, i had to implement solutions like customer relationship and advanced file sharing. After a few time installing dozens of servers, doing security patches and finding vulnerabilities i'm now confident enough to consider an real <b>SysAdmin</b>.</p>
<p>I'm proud enough to say that while servers are on my responsability, none got hacked by the traditional means. I was only affected by DDOS attacks and Spam related to the software it self, and not server security faults.</p>
<p>I monitor all the instances with open source technologies and for a few years i was able to provide free services like webhosting and file sharing thanks to the confort i felt administrating those servers without needing third party help.</p>
